<h3>Making the website</h3>

Frankly, I am not a coder, this is my first time using github. I knew HTML obviously and knew some basic C & C++ from high school.
So I inspected how websites I liked were coded and tried to understand.
I then used this desktop app called bootstrap studio for making it difficult for me to make mistakes.
